## Summary
  In this project, we investiagte the differences among the performance of the baseball players. It means no relation from the near overlapping two lines which one of them is marked as the highest 10 players on the scatter plot of height vs weight. The data doesn't show any connection the batting average and home runs whether are impacted by the player's height and weight by groupping them into several categories. The data show the general distributions of Batting Average and Home Runs vary along different handedness. We can see major players batting average score is from 0.2 to 0.299 and home runs under 100. It hardly to find the handedness impact the home runs or batting average. However, when batting average over 0.3, players perfer to left hand rather than right hand. The home runs don't related to the player's height or weight while the batting average show a general downward trend as the height or the weight adding. 

## Design
  The table with a sequential palette of blue are choosed for home runs and batting average groups to see which group the most players in. The bubble plot shows how height relates to weight, and includes home runs, encoded as size of each bubble. Using a diverging palette of blue-white-red shows batting average from negative to positive to observe the tendency.
  According to the feedback, I abbreviate the filter title for better understand on the decending bar plot of batting average. In order to increase readability, the sequential palette of red is removed from the bubble plot which presents how home runs vary with height and weight.
  
## Feedback
  From the figure of ordering batting average, a reader said it's could better if the legend title named more clearly. It's a little hard for him to understand the figure because the color and dot size change simultaneously on the last graphic about home runs vary with height and weight.
